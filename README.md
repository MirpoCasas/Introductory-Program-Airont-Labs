# Study Materials

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Martin Casas, and in this repo, I'll be sharing links I found useful when studying different subject related to my participation in Airont Labs' Front End Bootcamp.

This repo is made to serve as a complement to [my notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Da0-qGxoRTieJUleRJnHSkkc8AJ8JqqxhDF5RBbGgvE/edit?usp=sharing), for more practical and guided information.
