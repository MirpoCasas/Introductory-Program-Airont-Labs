# Study Material for git

## Links


I started with [Udemy Free Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123/).


Then I complemented with these YouTube Courses:

 - [Git Tutorial for Beginners - Git & GitHub Fundamentals In Depth](https://youtu.be/DVRQoVRzMIY/).
   
 - [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc).

This official [Repository](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github/) by GitHub explains in text the same as the before tutorials, for quick reference.

This other [Repository](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests) reviews pull requests and collaborations.

The [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) is another great source of information.
